It’s done. But is it perfect? Hell no! But I learned a lot and next time I do a huge project like this I better use something like SASS to better structure and organize my css code, because damn that’s a long css file that I’ve created.

I’m almost done with the site (thank god). I actually thought of quitting today, thinking “what’s the point” or “I could create more websites faster for ‘faster experience’”. But the truth is that building this site is teaching me so much and the only reason I actually want to quit is because of the challenge to learn everything that is needed in order to create this website (which is the whole point of creating it in the first place). So I told myself to keep pushing on, I told myself that I will finish this god damn website.

Didn’t think I would run into a problem that needed gribox this early in my webdev journey, but it happened, and it happened today. Those cards in the meeting section of the landing page took me most of the time to figure out how to place, but as soon as I realized it needed a gridbox it went much faster to structure them (just needed to look up on how to use gridbox lol). And at last I just had to apply a skew to the container that had the cards in it and viola!

Tomorrow I need to fix the layout of the section and add another pseudo element with a gradient on it. You’ll see what I mean when I apply it.

I went through hell to make the sections look like they cut through each other in a skewed way, but it sure was worth it. I tried creating triangles, skew the sections and much more. But I finally found a solution! You can use pseudo elements to “fake” the look of the sections cutting through each other (if you want to know how, just look in the css code). Oh and I also made progress in making the page responsive.

Didn’t do too much today, only had time for about 40minutes of work (still better than nothing). Downloaded three images and added them to the websites with some styling. That’s it.

Ok I have to start this off by saying that this website definitely is out of my comfort zone and at first I kind of wanted to change to something else, something more simple. But then I remembered a blog post that I read long ago that said: “The only way to grow, is to challenge yourself and always step out of your comfort zone.”. So that’s what I did and lo and behold, i’ve suddenly done something I thought would take me way more time than it did. All by just googling on the things I needed to know the most (ex when I learned what transform: skew() was it actually blew my mind haha).

Started this project today (a landing page) which is going to be heavily focused on the design and the look of the website. Let’s see how long this one takes...
